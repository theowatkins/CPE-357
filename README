LINE_MAX is 4096, but the command line cannot be larger than 4095 so that there remains null terminated.  I set the ARG_MAX(max number of args to a stage) and the STAGE_MAX(max number of stages) to 64.  I chose all of these numbers because they are squares of two which tend to make computers happy and they seemed large enough that it would be unreasonable for a human to type a pipeline that would exceed these limits.

I chose to use limits because I tried implementing it with everything dynamically allocated but I kept losing track of how much memory I was using.  I knew I was going to have trouble freeing everything so I just set the sizes.
