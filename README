Splitting up the work:
 - Theo: handled interrupts, implemented cd functionality, wrote most of parseline, helped with process control

 - Anna: revamped parseline, wrote most of the process control code, cleaned up parseline errors

GLOBAL VARIABLE: We have one global variable (gid) that stores the pid of the first forked child to be used as the group id for all the children.  It has to be global so that our SIGINT handler can pass it to killpg(). It can't be local to the handler because it needs to be set elsewhere.  

LINE_MAX is 4096, but the command line cannot be larger than 4095 so that it remains null terminated.  I set the ARG_MAX(max number of args to a stage) and the STAGE_MAX(max number of stages) to 64.  I chose all of these numbers because they are squares of two which tend to make computers happy and they seemed large enough that it would be unreasonable for a human to type a pipeline that would exceed these limits.
